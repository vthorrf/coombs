  ### Arguments
  # objbel: The object of belief (i.e., the subject)
  # kercon: The kernel concept (i.e., the predicate)
  # n.items: The number of items to be generated. Defaults to 6.
  # OPENAI_API_KEY: Your ChatGPT API key
  # lang: The language in which the items must be written. Defaults to "English"
  if(is.null(objbel)) stop("You must provide an object of belief!")
  if(is.null(kercon)) stop("You must provide a kernel concept!")
  if(is.null(OPENAI_API_KEY)) stop("Please provide your ChatGPT API key.")
  
  ### Setup your ChatGPT API key in R.
  ## First you will need to obtain your ChatGPT API key. You can create an API key by accessing
  ## OpenAI API page (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Donâ€™t miss their article about
  ## Best Practices for API Key Safety: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety
  ## Then you have to assign your API key for usage in R, this can be done just for the actual
  ## session, by doing:
  Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = OPENAI_API_KEY)
  
  ### Generate the prompt
  prompt <- paste0("Hi Assistant! A binary tree structure is a procedure used",
                   " to create psychometric items that are ordered in a single latent dimension.",
                   " The binary tree structure works like this:\n",
                   "Define that the items are a set of statements of the form \"X is Y\", ",
                   "where \"X\" is the object of belief, and \"Y\" is a predicate that ",

                   "Because the set of statements is unidimensional, the statements will vary only ",

                   "Then, the statements are created in an iterative manner, with the ",
